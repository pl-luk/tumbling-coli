# tumbling-coli

## Idea:
1. Bacteria object with a unit vector `lookingAt` for the direction in which the bacteria is facing and a `step()` function to calculate a run and tumble
2. loop until certain conditions are met (simulation steps of user interruption)
3. loop through each bacteria and call the step function
4. save the coordinates of each bacteria in a file and update the graphical interface
