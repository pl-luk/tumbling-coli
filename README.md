# tumbling-coli

## Idea 1:
This is in the `src/` subfolder.

1. Bacteria object with a unit vector `lookingAt` for the direction in which the bacteria is facing, the position and a `step()` function to calculate a run and tumble
2. loop until certain conditions are met (simulation steps of user interruption)
3. loop through each bacteria and call the step function
4. save the attributes of each bacteria in a file

### Step function
1. Draw a random angle from a normal distribution with mean 70Â°
2. rotate the `lookingAt` vector by that angle
3. Draw a random walking time from the exponential distribution
4. calculate the length of the walk with s = v * t
5. scale `lookingAt` and add it to the position vector to get the new positon
6. update the position vector
7. update the total runtime of the bacteria

## Idea 2:
This is in the `src2/` subfolder.

1. Draw runtimes from exponential distribution for all bacteria in chunks
2. Take the shape of the runtimes and draw angles from the normal distribution
3. Rotate an array of `N` `lookingAt` vectors at each timestep according to the angles
4. Update the positions
5. Save everything on disk
